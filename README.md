# Cucumber repo template

Contains templates that should be used in all other Cucumber repositories

## GitHub templates

Stores the templates used for issues and pull requests creations on GitHub. Synchronize your repo using this command:

```bash
./scripts/sync_github_templates <path to your repository>

# Example: ./scripts/sync_github_templates ~/dev/cucumber/cucumber-ruby
```

This script will delete the existing templates in the `.github` folder in your repository and add the new ones.

I add something here :)
